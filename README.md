# Academic Utilities

This repository contains  scripts that I developed for academic use.

## Repository Contents
- `hdf5_testing.m` - builds `gait_demo.h5`, adds attributes and datasets, then reloads and plots the joint angles.
- `matCreator.m` - mirrors the same data model using MATLAB structs and writes `gait_demo.mat`.
- `gait_demo.h5` - latest HDF5 artifact (overwritten each time the script runs).
- `gait_demo.mat` - latest MATLAB struct save.
- `hdf5Creator.py` - placeholder for a Python implementation of the HDF5 writer.
